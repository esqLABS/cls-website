- Support open access publishing workflows

## Planned Features

- **Data Repository**: Secure storage and version control for research data
- **Collaboration Tools**: Real-time collaboration and project management
- **Integration Hub**: Connect with existing research tools and workflows
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track research impact and collaboration metrics
- **Publishing Workflow**: Streamlined process for open access publishing

## Expected Impact

The platform will support:
- Enhanced research reproducibility
- Increased collaboration efficiency
- Better research data management
- Accelerated scientific discovery

Launch planned for Q1 2025 with initial focus on life sciences research institutions.
