We are thrilled to announce that the Computational Life Sciences Foundation (CLSF) has been officially certified as a US Public Charity through NGOsource's rigorous Equivalency Determination (ED) process. This milestone not only recognizes our commitment to transparency and public benefit, but also opens new doors for international collaboration and philanthropic support.

## What Does This Mean?

With this certification, CLSF is now recognized as equivalent to a US 501(c)(3) public charity. This status makes it easier than ever for US-based foundations, corporations, and individual philanthropists to support our mission—removing administrative barriers and streamlining the grantmaking process. Our ED certificate is valid through December 31, 2026, and is available to all NGOsource member grantmakers.

## Why Is This Important?

The ED certification is a powerful endorsement of our mission: advancing science and education in the life sciences through open-source software, open data, and open collaboration. It demonstrates that CLSF meets the highest standards of public benefit, accountability, and transparency—qualities that funders and partners value deeply.

## A Call to Action: Join Us in Transforming Life Sciences

This new status comes at a pivotal time. The need for open, accessible, and robust computational tools in the life sciences has never been greater.
